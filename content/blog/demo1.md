This is the text of the blog post. 
Programmers use a lot of symbols, often encoded with several characters. For the human brain, sequences like ->, <= or := are single logical tokens, even if they take two or three characters on the screen. Your eye spends a non-zero amount of energy to scan, parse and join multiple characters into a single logical one. 
Ideally, all programming languages should be designed with full-fledged Unicode symbols for operators, but thatâ€™s not the case yet.
